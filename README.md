# regnoCheckTs
This is a typescript code to check reg number.
The reg no must meet either one of the two conditions.

It must either be 7 digits and the first 2 index must be between 10 and 24.
OR
It must be 8 digits and the first 2 index must be greater than 25.

What inspired this is the vision that number of students admitted in the year 2025 and beyond becomes very much that there will be need to increase the reg no length.
